Hey {{creator_name:man}}, saw {{site_name:your site}} on Reddit!
Quick question, how do you currently handle questions from potential customers?

I built an AI chatbot that trains on your website and docs/blog. It answers customer questions, gives nudges/popups and routes user's issues to you with a ticketing system.

If you are looking to increase conversions by 20% and cut support time in half, it might be worth 10 minutes to test it.
